# [C] - Mathematical computational programs
Repository list for C programs conducting and evaluating problems related to computational logics with mathematical numericals.<br>
(Made during my second introductory CSE semester.)

## Subjects included:
    - Mathematics & Statistics
    - Applied mechanical concepts
    - Applied physics
    - Other stuff

## !NOT ACTIVELY EDITING ANYMORE!

<h2> Information: </h2>
This repository was made as a learning/storing tool for me learning the C language and providing an easier dive into low-level computational logic and allocation[s].
<br>Some programs were made during my 1st semester but I had not created this repository at the time.<br>
<br>There are a lot of comments within each program so as to conduce an easier understanding of syntax as well as the formula/concept utilised.<br>
I am more than glad if it decently helps someone to understand syntax or real-world problems, feel free to contact me for any suggestions or constructive criticisms!<br><br>
